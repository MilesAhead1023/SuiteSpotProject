// #detailed comments: MapList data
// Purpose: Static lists of maps/training/workshop entries used by the
// UI and loading logic. These containers are intentionally defined in
// a dedicated translation unit to keep the dataset separate from
// plugin logic. Treat these vectors as read-mostly: UI code clamps
// indices and never mutates them except through explicit add/refresh
// operations which then call Save/Load helpers.
//
// DO NOT CHANGE: The string values (map codes and display names) are
// referenced by cvar persistence and by user-visible labels; renaming
// or removing entries will alter user experience and saved selections.
